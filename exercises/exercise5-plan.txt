Plan
Create two tables:
	One for individual tweets
		Take unique tweet cases and feed info into a table
		Have tweet identifier and other tweet level variables
		Have user identifier to link back to users
	One for users
		Take unique user cases and feed info into a table
		Have user identifier to link to tweets
		Have other user level variables
			Since these tweets are all over a sort timeframe, treat user statistics as fixed, taking the user statistics from the tweet with the largest user_statuses_count
